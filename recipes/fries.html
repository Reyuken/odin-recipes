    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Loaded Sriracha Fries is a comforting, flavorful dish that combines tender shredded chicken with spaghetti noodles, all brought together in a creamy, cheesy sauce. Often made with a base of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup, the sauce is rich and savory, sometimes kicked up with diced tomatoes, green chilies, or bell peppers for added flavor and color. Topped with a generous layer of melted cheese—typically cheddar or a blend—it’s baked until bubbly and golden, creating a hearty, crowd-pleasing casserole.
