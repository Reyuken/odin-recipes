    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Loaded Sriracha fries are a bold and flavorful twist on the classic French fry, combining the crispy texture of fries with a spicy, savory kick. To make them, freshly fried potato strips are piled high and topped with a mix of ingredients like melted cheese, green onions, and a generous drizzle of creamy Sriracha sauce. The heat of the Sriracha is perfectly balanced with a creamy, slightly tangy sauce, often made by mixing Sriracha with mayo or sour cream, creating an irresistible combination. The addition of ingredients like crispy bacon bits, jalape√±os, or cilantro further elevates the flavor profile, making them a decadent and mouthwatering snack or side dish.
