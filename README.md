# odin-recipes
The project is about creating a simple website about recipes.It contains links to different pages which contains recipes of different foods selected by the author. (me, hehehe)

Stuff I did:
<ul>
  <li>Followed the instructions in the "Project: Recipes" section</li>
  <li>Added attrribution to the images i used.</li>
  <li>Forgot to commit often and ended up finishing a lot before doing my initial commit</li>
  <li>Got confused on when to commit. but decided to commit once a file is finished.</li>
  <li>Got confused but figured out how to edit committed/pushed files</li>
</ul>
Fun times!
