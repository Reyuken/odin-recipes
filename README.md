# odin-recipes
The project is about creating a simple website about recipes.It contains links to different pages which contains recipes of different foods selected by the author. (me, hehehe)

Stuff I did:
-Followed the instructions in the "Project: Recipes" section
-Added an attrribution to the images i used.
-Forgot to commit often and ended up finishing a lot before doing my initial commit
-Got confused on when to commit. but decided to commit once a file is finished.

Fun times!
